I want to share with you guyz a very simple simple "Web Movie Application." I used API from https://www.themoviedb.org/ 
I also used some modules and classes to build this small application.
I try my best not to make my code like spaghetti code, and I know a bit of DRY principles, so good for me.
You can even enhanced the code if you want and and any feature you want.
Have fun!
